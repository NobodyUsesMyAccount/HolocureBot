Hi, my first time uploading stuff
Here is a very simple Holocure fishing bot created with love from me

---HOW TO USE---
1. make sure that you have all the required libraries for the fishing bot
2. run the python file fishingv3.py
3. q to exit, e to start or stop fishing
4. enjoy

---REQUIRED LIBRARIES---
I currently haven't figured out how to automate library installation. Skill issue on my part.
Hence, you have to download the library yourself.

How to install libraries:
1. go to command prompt/terminal
2. type the following command:
    pip install [library name]
3. wait for it to be done

Here are the required libraries:
1. numpy
2. pyautogui

---MORE INFO---
From my totally and definitely accurate tests (source is that I made it the fuck up):
1. this bot earns around 500k coins per hour
2. this bot reached a maximum of 60 chains before it lost
3. this bot reaches a consistent 30 - 40 chains for most of the time
4. this bot is sometimes inconsistent as hell

*Extra note: this is just a fun project, I might not update it. Feel free to tinker with it.
*Extra notes for programmers who viewed my code: Yes I did not comment, yes I have spaghetti code, no I am not going to clean it.
